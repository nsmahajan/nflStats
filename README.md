Created a SPA using react to compare NFL Teams statistics based on average age of team players and determining
the height/weight trends between teams for defensive players.

This application is built using
1) create-react-app
2) semantic-ui
3) fontawesome icons
4) chartjs

Jest is used to test react components.
